    "## Introduction\n",
    "The goal of this project is to predict wildfire ignition risk in California from using a neural network trained on historical weather and wildfire data. Two approaches were attempted and scaled. The most effective approach was a parallel long short term memory network (pLSTM). The neural network portion of this project had six major phases. See below for more detail on each part.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. [Feature addition and smoothing](https://github.com/gperdrizet/wildfire/blob/master/notebooks/add_features.ipynb) - Added min, mean and max features for each weather variable and smooth the whole dataset with a daily average.\n",
    "2. [Stratified sampling](https://github.com/gperdrizet/wildfire/blob/master/notebooks/recursive_sampling.ipynb) - Dataset was split into fully stratified blocks of ~500,000 observations.\n",
    "3. [Small scale MLP](https://github.com/gperdrizet/wildfire/blob/master/notebooks/keras_MLP_skopt.ipynb) - The stratified samples were used to optimize and test a 'deep' neural network architecture using a binary 'fire/no fire' paradigm.\n",
    "4. [Scaled MLP]() - Insights gained from the small scale MLP were applied to the entire dataset.\n",
    "5. [Single LSTM](https://github.com/gperdrizet/wildfire/blob/master/notebooks/keras_LSTM_skopt_one_spatial_bin.ipynb) - A simple long short term memory based network architecture was optimized and tested on the full 22 years of data in just one geospatial bin.\n",
    "6. [Parallel LSTM](https://github.com/gperdrizet/wildfire/blob/master/notebooks/keras_parallel_LSTM_410input.ipynb) A parallel LSTM network consisting of 410 inputs, on for each geospatial bin, was trained on all 22 years of data."
