# Project Name
This project is a part of my Machine Learning Engineering capstone project at [Springboard](https://www.springboard.com/workshops/ai-machine-learning-career-track/).

#### -- Project Status: [Active]

## Project Intro/Objective
The purpose of this project is to predict wild fire ignition probability in California using historical fire and weather data. Wild fires are common, destructive and deadly natural disasters. Current risk prediction methods can be improved upon by applying modern machine learning techniques and incorporating historical wild fire data.

### Methods Used
* Inferential Statistics
* Machine Learning
* Data Visualization
* Predictive Modeling

### Technologies
* Python
* PySpark
* R
* Pandas
* GeoPandas
* Xarray
* Jupyter

## Project Description
This project is currently in the data wrangling phase. The goal its to collect and regularize the following data types for a time span of at least several years in California:
* Locations of past fire ignition sites
* Size of/area burned by past fires
* Temperature
* Humidity
* Precipitation
* Wind speed
This historical dataset will be used to train a machine learning model to predict wild fire ignition probability. After initial training and validation is complete the next phase of the project will be to deploy the model as a real time prediction service utilizing current fire activity data and weather predictions.
