# Project Name
This project is a part of my Machine Learning Engineering capstone project at [Springboard](https://www.springboard.com/workshops/ai-machine-learning-career-track/).

#### -- Project Status: [Active]

## Project Intro/Objective
The purpose of this project is to predict wild fire ingnition probability in California using historical fire and weather data. Wild fires are common, destructive and deadly natural disasters. Current risk prediction methods can be improved upon by applying modern machine learning techniques and incorporating historical wild fire data.

### Methods Used
* Inferential Statistics
* Machine Learning
* Data Visualization
* Predictive Modeling

### Technologies
* Python
* PySpark
* R
* Pandas
* GeoPandas
* Xarray
* jupyter

## Project Description
This project is currently in the data wrangeling phase. The goal its to collect and regularize the following data types for a time span of at least several years in California:
* Locations of past fire ignition sites
* Size of/area burned by past fires
* Temperature
* Humitidy
* Precipitation
* Wind speed


## Getting Started

1. Clone this repo (for help see this [tutorial](https://help.github.com/articles/cloning-a-repository/)).
2. Raw Data is being kept [here](Repo folder containing raw data) within this repo.

    *If using offline data mention that and how they may obtain the data from the froup)*
    
3. Data processing/transformation scripts are being kept [here](Repo folder containing data processing scripts/notebooks)
4. etc...

*If your project is well underway and setup is fairly complicated (ie. requires installation of many packages) create another "setup.md" file and link to it here*  

5. Follow setup [instructions](Link to file)
