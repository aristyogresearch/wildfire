# California Wildfire Probabillity Prediction

The goal of this project is to build a machine learning model which can predict wildfire innitiation probability in california from publicaly avaliblle meteorology data.

#### -- Project Status: [Active]

## Introduction

Wild fires are common, destructive and deadly natural disasters. Current risk prediction methods can be improved upon by: 
1. Applying modern machine learning techniques
2. Leveraging historical wild fire data for model training and validation

### Methods Used

* Inferential Statistics
* Machine Learning
* Data Visualization
* Cartographic Projection
* Time Series Analysis
* Feature Engineering
* Predictive Modeling

### Technologies

* Python
* PySpark
* Pandas
* NumPy
* Shaply
* GeoPandas
* Xarray
* Jupyter
* Matplotlib

## Project Description

This project is currently in the data wrangling phase. The goal is to collect and regularize the following data types in space and time:
* Locations of past fire ignition sites
* Past fire sizes
* Past fire severity codes
* Temperature
* Humidity
* Precipitation
* Wind speed
This historical dataset will be used to train a machine learning model to predict wild fire ignition probability. After initial training and validation is complete the next phase of the project will be to deploy the model as a real time prediction service utilizing current fire activity data and weather predictions.
